# Package com.stytch.sdk.consumer

## Using the Consumer SDK
The `StytchClient` object is your entrypoint to the Stytch Consumer SDK and is how you interact with all of our supported authentication products.

Each endpoint is explained in their respective READMEs and inline-documentation, but there are a few special methods on the `StytchClient` object to document here.

### **Configuration**
As mentioned in the [toplevel README](/README.md), before making any Stytch authentication requests, you must configure the `StytchClient`:
```kotlin
StytchClient.configure(context: Context, publicToken: String)
```
This configures the API for authenticating requests and the encrypted storage helper for persisting session data across app launches.

### **Handling Deeplinks**
`StytchClient.handle()` is the method you call for parsing out and authenticating deeplinks that your application receives. The currently supported deeplink types are: Email Magic Links, Third-Party OAuth, and Password resets. This method returns a [DeeplinkHandledStatus](../common/DeeplinkHandledStatus.kt) class which details the result of the authentication call.

For Email Magic Links and Third-Party OAuth deeplinks, it will return a `Handled` class containing either the authenticated response or error.

For Password Reset deeplinks, it will return a `ManualHandlingRequired` class containing the relevant token, so that you can provide an appropriate UI to the user for resetting their password. The returned token is used for making the subsequent `StytchClient.passwords.resetByEmail()` call.

Any other link types passed to this method will return a `NotHandled` class.
