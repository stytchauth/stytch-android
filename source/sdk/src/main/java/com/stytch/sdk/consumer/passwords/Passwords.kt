/**
 * The Passwords interface provides methods for authenticating, creating, resetting, and performing strength checks of
 * passwords.
 *
 * Stytch supports creating, storing, and authenticating passwords, as well as support for account recovery
 * (password reset) and account deduplication with passwordless login methods.
 *
 * Our implementation of passwords has built-in breach detection powered by [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com)
 * on both sign-up and login, to prevent the use of compromised credentials and uses configurable strength requirements
 * (either Dropbox’s [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) or adjustable LUDS) to guide members towards creating
 * passwords that are easy for humans to remember but difficult for computers to crack.
