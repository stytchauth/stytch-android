/**
 * The Discovery interface provides methods for discovering a member's available organizations, creating organizations,
 * and exchanging sessions between organizations.
 * The Discovery product lets End Users discover and log in to Organizations they are a Member of, invited to, or
 * eligible to join.
 *
 * Unlike our other B2B products, Discovery allows End Users to authenticate without specifying an Organization in
 * advance. This is done via a Discovery Magic Link flow. After an End User is authenticated, an Intermediate Session
 * is returned along with a list of associated Organizations.
 *
 * The End User can then authenticate to the desired Organization by passing the Intermediate Session and
 * organization_id. End users can even create a new Organization instead of joining or logging in to an existing one.
 *
 * Call the `StytchB2BClient.discovery.organizations()` method to find a member's available organizations.
 *
 * Call the `StytchB2BClient.discovery.exchangeSession()` method to exchange a session between organizations.
 *
 * Call the `StytchB2BClient.discovery.create()` method to create a new organization.
