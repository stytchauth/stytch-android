# Module Stytch Android
[Stytch](https://stytch.com) is an authentication platform, written by developers for developers, with a focus on
improving security and user experience via passwordless authentication. Stytch offers direct API integrations,
language-specific libraries, and SDKs (like this one) to make the process of setting up an authentication flow for your
app as easy as possible.

The module contains three packages that are of interest to a developer:
- **com.stytch.sdk.b2b**: Use this SDK to interact with your B2B Projects, Organizations and Members
- **com.stytch.sdk.consumer**: Use this SDK to interact with your Consumer Projects and Users
- **com.stytch.sdk.common**: This package contains resources shared between our B2B and Consumer SDKs
